There are more pieces of code, but they are hard to find.

To make your own turret and give it to yourself in-game, simply create a text file, and name it.
When you name the file, also change its ".txt" to ".lua"

I have provided the turret generating code in the turretSample.lua.






Make sure that the turret generating code that I gave you has been modified by you however you desire, and that it is placed in the
steam\steamapps\common\Avorion\data\scripts\commands\ folder.
(You do not need to restart the game every time you change the command for it to work. Also, keep in mind to SAVE it lol)
